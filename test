something("Animator")  -->   Here [something()] works as a placeholder, where we can fill data to complete the functions properly.

--> we can trigger two funtions at a time. Here's how...

function Your_age()
    print("you are just 17")
end
function Something(first_name)
    print("weclome " .. first_name)
 Your_age()
end

Something("Ari")  --> all error occured here in output.
